### A subtle machinery of awe...
Hi! I’m xfurna. You can call me xf.

I am also known as Archit. I don’t use it all the time, but the fact is, I am.

Currently, I am an undergrad senior at IIT Jodhpur. I was highly fascinated by programming right from the start when I was first introduced to it in school. Initially, I used to fool around exploring things like web development, automation, CLI app development, scripting, etc. Then in my 4th semester, I joined the Computational Biology lab as an Undergraduate Student Researcher under the guidance of Dr Sushmita Paul. There I got the taste of ML/DL for the very first time. And I was hooked! Now I have around two years of experience working there. During this time have investigated & developed various ML/DL algorithms and done statistical analyses on biological data. My research work has resulted in two publications in a reputed peer-reviewed journal and a highly competitive international conference respectively. I have only a few projects worth of experience in AI/ML, but the flip side of my inexperience tends to be energy, enthusiasm, and a willingness to work and hustle to learn.

I am a firm believer and practitioner of the first principle of thinking. I perceive the world in accordance with its function rather than its form. This mindset helps me to have a clear understanding of the things which, I believe, is a great step in the direction of the ideology of learning for mastery.

On best days, you’ll catch me reading books, research papers, doing math meditation, listening to podcasts, tweeting, pushing pixels or petting some or the other of my pet projects (boy, they're many). I can also be found walking/cycling distances while in the 'estado-de-resonancia' with the melodies of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple or the heavy/death metal of Opeth, S.O.A.D and Porcupine Tree (even Obituary, at times); Because only ideas won by walking have any worth.

I'm usually a man of few words in person. Nonetheless, hang out with me for an hour or two, only to find yourself in the extreme depths of the philosophical discourse on sheer existence of things!

If you would like to roll around in the dirt with me or just argue about whether or not Shakespeare really wrote Shakespeare's plays, don’t hesitate to contact me.

With a smile,
~ xf
